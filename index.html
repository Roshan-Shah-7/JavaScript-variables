        // Variables are like containers which are used to store data.
        // Three types :
        // 1. const : use when value or data is fixed and don't want to change it later
        // EG:
        const PI = 3.14233;
        // 2. var
        // Before ES6 var is used mostly
        // But the problem with var is that if we declare a variable inside a 
        // function without using let or const then this keyword becomes global.


        // 3. let
        // After ES6 let is introduce
        // Most of the time "let" is used
        // It works same as var but not global
        // If you declare a variable in a block
        // (anything between {}) then it will be limited to that block.
        let radius = 5;

        // let vs var
        // Scope: Variables declared with var are function-scoped,
        // meaning they are accessible within the function they are 
        // declared in, or globally if declared outside of any function. 
        // Where as
        // On the other hand, variables declared with let are block-scoped, 
        // which means they are only accessible within the block they are declared
        // in (e.g., inside a loop or an if statement).

        // Eg:
        function example() {
            var x = 10;
            let y = 20;

            if (true) {
                var x = 30; // This reassigns the outer variable x
                let y = 40; // This creates a new block-scoped variable y
                console.log(x); // Output: 30
                console.log(y); // Output: 40
            }

            console.log(x); // Output: 30
            console.log(y); // Output: 20 (outer y is still accessible)
        }

        example();
        

        // Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the 
        // top of their scope, which means they can be accessed before 
        // they are declared (although their value will be undefined). 
        // On the other hand, variables declared with let are not hoisted, 
        // and trying to access them before they are declared will result in 
        // a ReferenceError.

        // Here's an example to illustrate hoisting:
        console.log(x); // Output: undefined
        console.log(y); // Output: ReferenceError: y is not defined

        var x = 10;
        let y = 20;
        // In general, it is recommended to use let instead of var in 
        // modern JavaScript, as it provides better scoping and helps avoid 
        // some common pitfalls associated with var. However, there are still 
        // cases where var might be useful, especially when dealing with older 
        // codebases or specific use cases.




        // Rules:
        // 1.Don't start with number
        // 2.But can start wiht underscrole (_),letter
        // 3.Reserved word by JavaScript cannot use
        // 4.Case sensitive
        // like:
        let name = 'Roshan'
        let Name = 'Roshan'
        // both variable are different
